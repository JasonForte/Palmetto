                <p>
                    As part of the requirements of my degree it was required that I take on a self-driven research project. The aim of the project was to establish if I could undertake research and development in a practised and proper fashion and be weary of design methodologies. The project also showed if I could take an ill-defined proeject statement and produce a final engineering solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project I chose was: the design and development of a near-infared imaging system which could take snapshots of the back of a human hand and determine the vein structure. This had the ultimate intention of use in a biometrtric system.
                </p>

                <h3> <a name="project-background-and-premis" class="anchor" href="#project-background"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
                    Project Background and Premis
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The project was based on the phenomenon that blood with a higher concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> will absorb infrared more readily. By illuminating tha back of a hand with an infrared light and taking a picture with an infrared sensitive camera the dark vein reigons could be isolated and then inhanced using software.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Due to the penetrative strength of near-infrared the deep veins could be detected. Near infrared must be distinguished from far infrared which would provide a heat signature rather than an absorption difference.
                </p>

                    Results

                <p>
                    The project turned out to be a success and was able to provide images that vasty increased the visibilty of the vein structures of the hand.

                    In addition to the project - a the submission of a full report was required. The final report is linked below (Dropbox).

                    The project also required the creataion of a poster which is shown below. It gives a breif review of the project.

                <p>
                    This project was built by hand using fairly low cost materials. The software was developed in python using the opencv library.
                    All the programming was done in Linux.

                    I have released this project to enforce my belief in open source and open research and collaboration. If you wish to know any details of this project please send me a message via github <a href="http://www.github.com/DustioDesign">@DustioDesign</a> or find me on twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/forteisme">@forteIsMe</a>.

                <p>
                    Note that although I aim to provide open content I do not consent to this project being sumbitted under someone else's name where the outcome could result in an academic mark or award (i.e. plagarism).
