\section{Biometrics as a Verification Technique}

Over the past few decades there has been a gradual shift into the virtual domain. As more people go online there becomes a greater incentive for companies to provide online services. However this expansion into the digital domain comes at a cost. As individuals add more and more services to their virtual network they become bogged down in keeping up with passwords. While a common method is to use the same password for all your online accounts this is usually not recommended because a vulnerability in one service can compromise the entire system. This can be even more detrimental if the password is also associated with a banking service.
